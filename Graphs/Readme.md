# Graphs

    The definition of a graph refers to the group of edges as a collection, not a
    set, thus allowing two undirected edges to have the same end vertices, and for two
    directed edges to have the same origin and the same destination. Such edges are
    called parallel edges or multiple edges.

    With few exceptions, graphs do not have parallel edges or self-loops. Such

graphs are said to be simple. T

    1. A subgraph of a graph G is a graph H whose vertices and edges are subsets of the vertices and edges of G, respectively.

    2. A spanning subgraph of G contains all the vertices of the graph G.

    3. If a graph G is not connected, its maximal connected subgraphs are called the connected components of G.

    4. A forest is a graph without cycles.

    5. A tree is a connected forest, that is, a connected graph without cycles.

    6. A spanning tree of a graph is a spanning subgraph that is a tree.
